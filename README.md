# Koch SnowFlake Generator
Koch SnowFlake fractal generator

A **pentagon-base fractal**, i uses a pentagon as a base to construct itself.


> How it works:
- *Randomly* selecting one of the blue cordinates, except the last one selected
- Calculating the *midle point* on the **X** and **Y** axis
- Draw a single white pixel on that cordinates

***It works by rounding the number when calculating cordinates, therefore, some pixel will be empty***
